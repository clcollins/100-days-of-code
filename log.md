# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created the beginnings of GoREST, a RESTful app I'm using to learn how to write Go...and REST apps.

**Thoughts:** I spent an inordinate amount of time developing a project frameworks for building and shipping the app in Docker contianers.  I didn't count this toward the hour, but it took longer than I thought it would.  Luckily it's re-usable for other projects.

I ran into some issue with variable assignment.  I kept getting syntax errors expecting "{" after assigning a variable.  I am not sure *how* I fixed it.  I think *maybe* the word "interface" is a reserved word?  Or maybe I just changed enough that when I switched it to "iface" everything worked.   All this to just print a message about what interface I'm listening on...

I want to start writing tests from the begining here, but I'm unsure how to do that with the app I've written so far. I've read how tests work in Go, so I get the idea, but how do you test a REST api?
